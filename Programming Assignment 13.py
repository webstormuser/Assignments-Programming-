# 1.Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
# Example: Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:100,150,180
# The output of the program should be: 18,22,24

# 2.Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
# Example: Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5
# Then, the output of the program should be:[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

# 3.Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically ?

# 4.Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

# 5.Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

# 6.A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 
# At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# At least 1 number between [0-9]
# At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# At least 1 character from [$#@]
# Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# Maximum length of transaction password: 12
# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
# 
# Example:
# If the following passwords are given as input to the program: ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:ABd1234@1
